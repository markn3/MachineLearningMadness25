# 2. Prepare a new input sample with the same feature names as used in training.
# For example, let's assume your training features were:
# 'seed_diff', 'roll_net_diff', 'roll_off_diff', 'roll_def_diff',

# Typically, predictions will be a DataFrame with columns for each class.
# If your target is binary (0 and 1) and you've set up your predictor such that 1 = Team1 wins,
# then you might extract the column for class 1:
matchup_features_df["Pred"] = predictions[1]

# Now, you can create the final submission file with the ID and Pred columns.
